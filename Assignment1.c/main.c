/* Program: This program is developed to perform the operations of an ATM machine.
 The program shows a welcome screen and the options the user has to perform the operations.
 option 1 allows the user to enter his / her PIN, option 2 allows the user to change the PIN after a double check,
 option 3 shows the amount of times that the user entered his PIN correctly and wrong and option 4 terminates
 the program and shows a farewell message.
